# Sales-Analysis

Objective: Build and manage the SalesAnalysis database for tracking sales, customer, employee, and product data with various queries and optimizations.

Key Features:

Database Structure: 7 relational tables (Countries, Cities, Customers, Employees, Products, Sales, Categories).
Data Integrity: Checks for null values, duplicate records, and data consistency across tables.
Sales Insights: Generates valuable insights like total sales per month, top-selling products, customer behavior, and salesperson effectiveness.
Query Optimization: Indexing key tables to improve query performance and efficient use of EXISTS instead of IN.
Main Tables:

Countries: Stores country info (CountryID, CountryName).
Cities: Contains city info linked to countries (CityID, CityName, Zipcode).
Customers: Customer details (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, CityID).
Employees: Employee data (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, BirthDate).
Products: Product details (ProductID, ProductName, Price, CategoryID).
Sales: Sales transaction data (SalesID, SalesPersonID, CustomerID, ProductID, Quantity, TotalPrice).
Usage:

Setup: Create the database and tables using provided SQL script.
Import Data: Import data into tables for analysis.
Run Queries: Execute queries to analyze sales, identify trends, and make business decisions.
Optimization: Indexes created on frequently queried fields for better performance.

Got it! Here's a revised version of your Sales Analysis Database project summary, emphasizing your SQL skills such as handling null values, cleaning data, performing inserts, imports, and using SQL queries like joins and subqueries:

Sales Analysis Database - SQL Project
Objective: Developed the SalesAnalysis database to manage and analyze sales, customer, product, and employee data using SQL queries and optimization techniques.

Key Skills & Techniques Demonstrated:

Data Cleaning:
Checked for null values across tables (e.g., customers, sales, products) and ensured data integrity.
Handled missing or inconsistent data through SQL queries to maintain clean datasets.

Data Insertion & Import:
Performed data import from CSV files into SQL tables using LOAD DATA INFILE or similar methods.
Executed INSERT statements to populate the tables with sample data.

SQL Queries:
Wrote complex SQL queries to extract meaningful business insights.

Joins: Used INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN to combine multiple tables (e.g., joining sales and customers to track sales data).

Subqueries: Implemented subqueries to filter and aggregate data (e.g., retrieving the top-selling products using subqueries).

Group By & Aggregate Functions: Used GROUP BY and aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, and AVG to analyze sales and customer behavior.

Handling Duplicates:
Checked for duplicate records in key tables (customers, products, sales) using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.
Implemented query logic to remove or handle duplicates effectively.

Data Validation & Integrity Checks:
Verified total records in each table and ensured data consistency with custom validation queries.
Applied data checks to ensure all foreign key relationships were intact and there were no orphan records.

Performance Optimization:
Added indexes on frequently queried fields like SalesDate, ProductID, and CustomerID for faster query execution.
Applied best practices for SQL query optimization to reduce execution time and improve database performance.

Main Tables:
Countries, Cities, Customers, Employees, Products, Sales, Categories: Designed 7 interconnected relational tables.

Example Queries & Insights:

Total Sales per Month:

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(SalesDate, '%Y-%m') AS Month, SUM(TotalPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month;

Top-Selling Products using JOIN and GROUP BY:

SELECT P.ProductID, P.ProductName, SUM(S.Quantity) AS TotalUnitsSold, SUM(S.TotalPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Sales S
JOIN Products P ON S.ProductID = P.ProductID
GROUP BY P.ProductID
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
LIMIT 10;

Optimization:

Indexed key columns for faster searches.
Replaced inefficient IN queries with EXISTS for faster lookups.


Skills Highlighted:
SQL: Data cleaning, inserts, imports, joins, subqueries, and aggregation.
Database Design: Relational database design with primary and foreign key constraints.
Optimization: Indexing, query optimization for performance.
Data Validation: Ensured integrity and handled duplicates, null values, and missing data.
